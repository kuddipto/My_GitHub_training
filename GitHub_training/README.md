## Training documents for git and GitHub

#### Author: Sean Burnard
#### Date: 19.01.21

#### Purpose: This is currently an 'in-house' introductory training session for git and GitHub, focused on the benefits and basics for users coming from a biological research background. i.e. basic (and easy) implementation of accessing, creating and editing repos rather than the utility of git for version control (which is more important to programmers).

By the end of this introductory session you will:   

      Know the difference between Git and GitHub
      Understand the basic workflow of Git
      Created your own repo
      Forked and edited a repo
      Created your own live webpage (GitHub page)
      And hopefully - realise the versatility and benefits of GitHub!! :)
